Atomic Red Team
========================

**Atomic Red Team** tests are small, highly portable detection tests mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. Each test is designed to map back to a particular tactic. This gives defenders a highly actionable way to immediately start testing their defenses against a broad spectrum of attacks.
