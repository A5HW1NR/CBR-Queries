========================
Carbon Black Response - Queries
========================

Daily/weekly I perform hunts across a large fleet of endpoints and part of my process is to generate CBR Queries to:

1. Automate (alert) the hunt
2. Reproduce the hunt
3. Assist others

A lot of the queries are not meant to "alert" out of the box. Each query will need to be tuned for your environment and may not be something to alert on at all.

Happy Hunting.
